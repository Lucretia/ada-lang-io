# Starting an SDL2 project with SDLAda

The source code is in flux at the moment and there is an SDL specific game jam
coming up in August that I would like Ada people to enter to show what a good
language Ada is for game development.

**N.B**: In the following tutorial, use your own _game name_ where **`ada_game`**
is shown, use underscores to separate the words within the name.

This quite a long tutorial, but if we weren't using SDL2, it would be even longer.

Create a directory or find a suitable directory for you game development source and
use [Alire](https://ada-lang.io) to create a new project:

```console
$ mkdir sdl2-tut
$ cd sdl2-tut
$ alr init --bin ada_game
Enter a short description of the crate: (default: '')

```

**N.B:** For the Ada LSP server to do autocomplete with VSCode, the following export needs
to be defined before you start the editor:

```console
$ export GPR_PROJECT_PATH="./alire/cache/pins/sdlada:./alire/cache/pins/sdlada_image:./alire/cache/pins/sdlada_mixer:./alire/cache/pins/sdlada_ttf"
```

Edit the source:

```console
$ cd ada_game
$ alr edit
```

Add the following to the end of the `toml.alire`:

```toml
...
executables = ["ada_game"]

[[depends-on]]
  sdlada       = "*"
  sdlada_mixer = "*"
  sdlada_image = "*"
  sdlada_ttf   = "*"

[[pins]]
  sdlada       = { url = "git@github.com:ada-game-framework/sdlada.git" }
  sdlada_mixer = { url = "git@github.com:ada-game-framework/sdlada_mixer.git" }
  sdlada_image = { url = "git@github.com:ada-game-framework/sdlada_image.git" }
  sdlada_ttf   = { url = "git@github.com:ada-game-framework/sdlada_ttf.git" }
```

Now change the `ada_game.gpr` file, such that the `Compiler` section looks like
this:

```ada
   package Compiler is
      for Default_Switches ("Ada") use Ada_Game_Config.Ada_Compiler_Switches &
         ("-gnat2022", "-gnatyM120");
   end Compiler;
```

Now do a test build:

```ada
$ alr build
```

It should checkout the subprojects into `alire/cache/pins` and build successfully.

## Creating a hardware accelerated window

Open the `src/ada_game.adb` source file in your editor. The first thing we want
to do is to open a window for the game to be displayed within, edit the file such
that it looks like the following:

```ada
with Ada.Strings.UTF_Encoding.Wide_Wide_Strings;
with SDL.Video.Windows.Makers;

procedure Ada_Game is
   package Encoders renames Ada.Strings.UTF_Encoding.Wide_Wide_Strings;
   package Windows renames SDL.Video.Windows;

   Game_Window : Windows.Window;
   Window_Size : constant SDL.Positive_Sizes := (640, 480);
begin
   Windows.Makers.Create
     (Win      => Game_Window,
      Title    => Encoders.Encode ("Ada SDL2 Tutorial"),
      Position => Windows.Centered_Window_Position,
      Size     => Window_Size);

   delay 3.0;
end Ada_Game;
```

Build and run, this should make the screen flicker and will probably copy the existing
screen contents to the new window, then it will close.

```console
$ alr run
```

## Adding a game loop

We want the game to do more than just show a window for a bit and then exit. So,
we need a game loop, you can use a while loop:

```ada
while not Finished loop
   --  Do things in here.
end loop;
```

Or an infinite loop:

```ada
loop
   --  Do things in here.

   exit when Finished;
end loop;
```

Pick one of these and replace the delay statement with it, don't forget to add
the condition variable.

## Exiting the game

We don't want the game to execute forever, so we need a nice clean way to exit
the game. A real game would have a menu displayed which would provide an exit
option. For this example, we'll exit the game with the Escape key and the close
window icon.

**N.B:** The `SDL.Events.*` package hierarchy is a lot of a mess, they will
be changed in future. I originally wanted to have separate packages for each kind
of event, mouse, keyboard, etc. But due to Ada's view of packages, I couldn't
the final Event record which combines them all the way I wanted.

We need an `Events` object we can pull the current event into so we can
examine it:

```ada
Event : SDL.Events.Events.Events;
```

As we have used this package, we need a `with` clause:

```ada
with SDL.Events.Events;
```

Then we can add the even polling loop, replace the "Do things in here." comment:

```ada
      while SDL.Events.Events.Poll (Event) loop
         case Event.Common.Event_Type is
            when SDL.Events.Quit =>
               Finished := True;

            when SDL.Events.Keyboards.Key_Up =>
               if Event.Keyboard.Key_Sym.Key_Code = SDL.Events.Keyboards.Code_Escape then
                  Finished := True;
               end if;

            when others =>
               null;
         end case;
      end loop;
```

This won't compile because the `Key_Code` operators aren't visible, add the
following line after the previous package `renames` statement:

```ada
   use type SDL.Events.Keyboards.Key_Codes;
```

Now run and test that the escape key and the close window button work as expected.

## Switching between full screen and windowed modes

A player might want to use a windowed mode instead of full screen, so allow a
way to switch.

A real game would have a menu system which provided a way to select a screen
resolution and whether it's windowed or not.

```ada
      Position => Windows.Centered_Window_Position,
      Size     => Window_Size);
```

To:

```ada
      Position => Windows.Centered_Window_Position,
      Size     => Window_Size,
      Flags    => Mode or Windows.OpenGL);
```

The variable `Mode` needs to be created:

```ada
   Mode        : Windows.Window_Flags := Windows.Windowed;
```

Now we can extend the event loop `if` statement with the following which
will change the window mode:

```ada
               elsif Event.Keyboard.Key_Sym.Key_Code = SDL.Events.Keyboards.Code_F then
                  if Mode = Windows.Windowed then
                     Mode := Windows.Full_Screen_Desktop;
                  elsif Mode = Windows.Full_Screen_Desktop then
                     Mode := Windows.Windowed;
                  end if;

                  Windows.Set_Mode (Game_Window, Mode);
```

## Creating a blank canvas

In SDL2, the way to draw the screen is to render to a texture, and then present
that texture to the renderer. This is basically, off screen rendering.

With the correct packages:

```ada
with SDL.Video.Pixel_Formats;
with SDL.Video.Renderers.Makers;
with SDL.Video.Textures.Makers;
```

We need to add both a renderer and a texture to render:

```ada
   Renderer : SDL.Video.Renderers.Renderer;
   Texture  : SDL.Video.Textures.Texture;
```

Add two more renames:

```ada
   package Pixel_Formats renames SDL.Video.Pixel_Formats;
   package Renderers renames SDL.Video.Renderers.Makers;
   package Textures renames SDL.Video.Textures.Makers;
```

After the window creation function, add the following:

```ada
   Renderers.Makers.Create (Window => Window,
                            Rend   => Renderer,
                            Flags  => Accelerated);
```

The Flags just specify that we want a hardware accelerated renderer.

Following this, we need to create a texture which will be our game world, or
screen drawing surface. This will be used to implement double buffering, as you'll
normally draw to the texture, then present it to the renderer which will then
draw the texture onto the window.

```ada
   Textures.Makers.Create (Tex      => Texture,
                           Renderer => Renderer,
                           Format   => Pixel_Formats.Pixel_Format_ARGB_8888,
                           Kind     => Textures.Streaming,
                           Size     => Window_Size);
```

Specifying the pixel format as ARGB 8888, just means your colour palette can use
the full 24-bit colour range with 8-bits of transparency (alpha channel).

You will normally want the texture size to be the same size as the window. The
main reason for having a smaller texture is for pixel art style games, where you
would specify a a much smaller texture which is then scaled by SDL2 when presented
to the renderer to the ful screen. Adam C. Younis has a good explanation of which
resolutions to use for this in his [canvas sizes](https://youtu.be/upEGBGCiWEw?si=v8aqmpol-CkRfiIl&t=1020) video.

Now to present the thing to the screen. After the event while loop, add the
following lines:

```ada
      Renderer.Clear;
      Renderer.Present;
```

When you run this game, you will now have a black window, yay!
